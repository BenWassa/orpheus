# Project Orpheus

**Decode your emotional underworld through the music that moves you.**

---

## 📜 Vision

Project Orpheus is an introspective exploration of the self through music. By analyzing personal listening patterns — recurring obsessions, sudden fixations, shifting phases — it maps the hidden emotional currents shaping your inner life. Inspired by the myth of Orpheus, who descended into darkness guided by song, this project transforms your listening history into a lantern for self-discovery.

## 🎻 Core Idea

- **Reveal Emotional Patterns:** Discover recurring moods, fixations, and subconscious themes.
- **Trace Life Narratives:** Connect musical phases to pivotal life events and hidden transitions.
- **Deepen Self-Awareness:** Use your own music history as a profound tool for reflection and growth.

---

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Collect:** Gather listening data (e.g., streaming history, playlists).
2. **Analyze:** Detect repeat patterns, emotional spikes, sudden obsessions.
3. **Map:** Visualize musical phases as an emotional timeline.
4. **Reflect:** Interpret patterns through mythic symbolism and guided prompts.

- **Future:** Develop frameworks or tools for ongoing self-reflection.

## 🌙 Metaphor

Just as Orpheus journeyed into the underworld with music as his guide, Project Orpheus helps you descend into your emotional depths — not to dwell in darkness, but to retrieve hidden truths, lost memories, and fresh self-understanding.
